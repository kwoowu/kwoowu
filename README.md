Hihi! I'm a computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I'm TAing [Introduction to Computer Systems](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/) and developing course content for [Compiler Design](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15411-s25/www/). Previously, I've TAed [Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) and interned at Amazon.

Once I find the time to actually build it (:'D), you'll be able to find me at my website - http://www.wu-kai.run/ (it's my Chinese name! :D)
